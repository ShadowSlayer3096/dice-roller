# dice-roller
This is basically a complete ripoff of the Google Dice Roller. I decided to remake it because I swapped away from Chrome.

Anyway, I don't think there's much to say. You'll need the "pygame" library to run this, but otherwise it should work fine. Just open the "run.bat" file and it'll do the rest.
You're free to modify/change/reupload/etc as you wish, no credit required. Enjoy!

Also, I'm still fairly new to coding so please be nice. Ignore the arbitrary fluctuations between snake and camel casing.
